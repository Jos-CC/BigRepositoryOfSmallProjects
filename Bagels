#In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you
#must guess a secret three-digit number
#based on clues. The game offers one of
#the following hints in response to your guess:
#“Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the
#wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct
#digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess
#has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the
#secret number.
